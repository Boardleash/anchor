# Some things to look into so far:

# --> Find alternatives to gtts-cli, gtts and espeak (THIS HAS NOW TAKEN PRIORITY)
# --> Need to fine tune to only have the program recognize 'Maris' and then other key words
# --> Need to silence the output info messages from the audio program on the terminal
# --> Need to configure a service file to run this at startup (debating whether to always have it running
#     i,e. always listening
# --> Look into a different audio recognition interpreter (google is used in this example; not bad,
#     but what else is there?)
# --> Interface with calendars
# --> Have the program create an agenda file based on waht the user tells it to create
# --> Noticed that when running on Windows, there is no microphone mixer output on the terminal;
#     this is not the case for Linux.  Why?
# --> Determine whether to implement os.system or subprocess for Python OS calls
# --> All functions have been tested and work independently, but have issues when using or to 
#     call the required function based on specific speech command (need to figure this out)

# Just some rando notes:

#flatpak run org.strawberrymusicplayer.strawberry &
#strawberry -p &
    # Try to display what was spoken, using google in this example
    #try:
    #    print("Text: "+listener.recognize_google(audio_text))
    # Throw and exception if the speech was unrecognizable
    #except:
    #    print("I did not understand.")
